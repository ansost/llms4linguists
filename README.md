# Course website for `LLMs in Linguistic Research`

This website is forked from the [quarto-template-for-university-courses](https://github.com/jonjoncardoso/quarto-template-for-university-courses) repo. Their README contains information about the setup for this template.

**Course description:**

This course will introduce you to the exciting world of Large Language Models (LLMs) and their applications in linguistic research. You will start by learning the basics of LLMs, including their architecture, capabilities, and limitations.

You will then explore how to use LLMs for a range of linguistic tasks, such as text analysis, language generation, and language understanding. You do not need to know how to code. We will provide pre-written code samples, so you can focus on the linguistic applications and interpretations. By the end of this course, you will have a solid understanding of LLMs and their potential in linguistic research, and be equipped to apply them to your own projects.
