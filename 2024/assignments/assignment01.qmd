title: "Assignment 1: Perceptron Analysis"
---
Consider a perceptron that predicts if you'll pass a quiz based on:

- Hours studied (0-5)
- Hours slept (0-8)

Part1: Make predictions for:

1. Different study patterns:

- Studied 4 hours, slept 7 hours
- Studied 1 hour, slept 8 hours
- Studied 5 hours, slept 4 hours
- Studied 3 hours, slept 3 hours
- Studied 4 hours, slept 4 hours

2. Weight changes:
- Study hours more important
- Sleep hours more important
- Both equally important

Draw simple diagrams showing:

- How you think the perceptron would classify each case
- Why some combinations might work better than others

Part 2: Predict what happens when:

1. The perceptron starts with:

- Thinking only study hours matter
- Thinking only sleep matters
- Thinking nothing matters (zero weights)

2. The perceptron learns from:
- One student's data
- Five students data
- Twenty students data

Explain in simple terms:

- How you think it would change its decisions
- Why more data might help
- What problems it might face

**NOTE:**

- No calculations needed
- Keep explanations simple
- You will be graded on:
	- clarity of explanation
	- use of diagrams to support your explanation
